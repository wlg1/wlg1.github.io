    - ✅ try get unablated (orig) logit diff score
        - ✅ ISSUE: freezes when tokenizing dataset for `dataset = Dataset(prompts_list, pos_dict, model.tokenizer)` because of long list of `Keyword arguments {'add_special_tokens': False} not recognized.`
            - search this repo for why Keyword arguments {'add_special_tokens': False} not recognized. occurs when llama 2 uses model.tokenizer: [https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens)
                
                The issue you're experiencing with the `{'add_special_tokens': False}` keyword argument not being recognized appears to be related to how different tokenizers handle the addition of special tokens (such as beginning-of-string tokens) to inputs. Specifically, in the context of the TransformerLens project, there have been discussions and fixes regarding how the OPT and LLaMA models' tokenizers prepend tokens to the inputs.
                
                For the Facebook OPT tokenizer, it was observed that it automatically prepends a `</s>` token to OPT prompts unless the tokenizer call explicitly sets `add_special_tokens=False`. This behavior was not affecting the GPT tokenizer. A solution proposed was to conditionally set `add_special_tokens=False` based on the model type, specifically for OPT models, to prevent this automatic prepending from happening【5†source】.
                
                Further discussion on this topic suggested that handling of the `add_special_tokens` parameter might need to be more nuanced, potentially involving checks against the model's tokenizer name or the model architecture to ensure compatibility across different models without introducing unexpected bugs【5†source】【6†source】.
                
                Another related issue was reported for LLaMA models, where the beginning-of-string (bos) token was always prepended for strings processed by the `HookedTransformer` methods, which use the `.to_tokens()` function. This was due to the `add_special_tokens=False` setting not being applied to LLaMA models, although LLaMA's tokenizer, similar to OPT's, adds a bos token by default. A fix was proposed to automatically infer the `add_special_tokens` parameter for the tokenizer, addressing the issue where an extra bos token was being added unintentionally【7†source】.
                
                These discussions and fixes illustrate the importance of carefully managing tokenizer settings and the `add_special_tokens` parameter when working with different models within the TransformerLens project or similar frameworks. The goal is to ensure that tokenization behavior aligns with the expectations for each specific model type, preventing issues like unwanted token prepending.

                The logit diff isn’t measured by the 1st rank token minus incorr token. It’s what’s marked as the correct token, regardless of if correct token is 1st ranked or not. This means it doesn’t matter what

    - ✅ Try pure seq instead for 12 samps
        - ISSUE: the incorr token logits are higher than corr token logits (neg diff score)
            - Check token ids of prompts and corr, incorr.
                
                Notice we use up to 14. The padding for llama’s tokenzier on numbers after 10 seeems to split them up, meaning there is more padding on “1 2 3 4” earlier prompts. Does this make a difference? Yes; putting it in with extra padding messes it up, not predicting “5”. 
                
- ✅ if you add padding to the end of a prompt, will transformers treat the padding as different than if there was no padding, and predict for the padding as the last token instead?
    
    Yes, when you add padding to the end of a prompt for a transformer model, it can affect the model's predictions, but perhaps not in the way you might initially think. Padding tokens are a special kind of token used to bring sequences of words or tokens to a uniform length, enabling batch processing of input data by the model. These padding tokens are typically ignored by the model during predictions due to the use of attention masks.
    
    In the context of natural language processing (NLP) and transformer models, an attention mask is applied to specifically ignore these padding tokens during the attention calculations. The attention mechanism is a core component of transformer models, allowing them to focus on relevant parts of the input data when making predictions. By using an attention mask, the model can differentiate between actual input data and padding, effectively treating the padding as non-existent for the purposes of prediction.
    
    So, while the presence of padding alters the input sequence, the model is designed to predict ignoring these padding tokens as if they were not part of the input. This means that the model will not "predict for the padding as the last token" because, from the model's perspective, the padding tokens are masked out and do not influence the prediction of actual content tokens.
    
    However, the addition of padding can still have indirect effects on model performance, especially if the padded sequences are significantly longer than the original content, potentially impacting computational efficiency. But as far as predictions go, transformer models are designed to handle padding gracefully and predict as if the padding were not there, thanks to attention masking.
    
- ✅ Try for only 1 sample to avoid inconsistent padding issues

    - ✅ ISSUE: orig score still neg, same values for first prompt, despite `utils.test_prompt` now correctly predicting 5 (example prompt has no padding at end)
        
        So padding wasn’t the issue

            Either:
            
            1. It’s predicting using the empty space as the prompt (not likely bc/ then all prompts would be the same prediction, but this isn’t happening)
            2. Or, it uses the prompt as input but will predict empty space

    - ✅ Give space in prompt end to get logits
        
        It works
        
- ✅ post on ARENA slack your findings
    
    It seems that when I tried a prompt like "1 2 3 4", the llama model in transformerlens, the tokens with the highest logit would be the "" empty space, and the top 5 wouldn't have "5" either. But using "1 2 3 4 " with a space at the end allowed 5 to be the token with the highest logit. Still looking for a better work around as this seems gimmicky. Also, seem to be running of memory easily with A100 for llama-2 so may switch to nnsight as I did before.

    - ✅ ISSUE: S0 lookup issue because pos_dict starts using S1 hard-coded, so change to S0 to S3 instead in both prompts_lsit and Pos_dict and prompst_list_2
    - ✅ ISSUE: Now the loop tries to find S4, saying it’s not found. So look in code to see why it’s looking for S4 when neither prompts_list nor pos_dict have it as a key.
        
        ```python
            SEQ_POS_TO_KEEP = {}
            for i in range(len(model.tokenizer.tokenize(dataset_2.prompts[0]['text']))):
                CIRCUIT['S'+str(i)] = lst
                if i == len(model.tokenizer.tokenize(dataset_2.prompts[0]['text'])) - 1:
                    SEQ_POS_TO_KEEP['S'+str(i)] = 'end'
                else:
                    SEQ_POS_TO_KEEP['S'+str(i)] = 'S'+str(i)
        ```
        
        SOLN: Running this in colab, we find there’s 8 positions because the random prompt using integers greater than 10, which breaks down into tokens of more than 1.

        Seems like the llama tokenizer.tokenize works differently than the tokenizer for GPT-2, which would break ‘1 4 4 3’ into just four tokens for each integer instead of making each space be a token

    This deletes previous explora tests and cleans up code. Don’t hard code pos dict but make key for every tokenized token

    > using `'use_fast'= False, 'add_prefix_space'= False` when defining the tokenizer makes the problem go away (though you have to add spaces manually. it's a bit messy
    > 
    
    This doesn’t fix test prompt. Getting rid of space at end also makes it predict ‘ ‘ instead of corr token.
    
- ✅ respond to slack about persisting issue
    
    I added them using tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(LLAMA_2_7B_CHAT_PATH, use_fast= False, add_prefix_space= False) and it fixes encode and decode (encode('5') encodes it into padding <s> and 5 IDs without the ' ') but it seems test_prompt still has two rankings for ' ' and 5 (it's not directly used in ablation so it doesn't need to be correct) and logits_original = model(dataset.toks) still predicts empty space ' ' as the top token unless the space is added to the end of the input prompt (I suppose this is what you meant by add spaces manually)? 
    
- ✅ Llama2_num_runModel_explrTests_v3: fix why are the scores all negative
    
    SOLN:  You changd the wrong line of code of what to ablate. 
    
    ```
    circ = [(layer, head) for layer in range(32) for head in range(29, 31)]
    to_loop = circ.copy()
    ```
    
    `circ` should ALWAYS start off as the full circuit, while to_loop should contain which heads to remove from circ one by one but independent of one another (this isn’t acdc yet)!

    Llama-2 NEEDS A100 high-ram just to load; V100 won’t work
    
    - why A100 has more memory than V100
        
        The NVIDIA A100 and V100 are both high-performance GPUs designed for data center use, catering to different demands in computation, AI, and deep learning tasks. The A100, being a more recent addition to NVIDIA's lineup, boasts more memory than the V100 due to several factors:
        
        1. **Technological Advancements**: Since the A100 is newer, it benefits from advancements in semiconductor and memory technologies, allowing for higher memory capacities within the same physical space constraints.
        2. **Increased Data Demands**: Modern AI and machine learning workloads have grown in complexity and size, necessitating GPUs with more memory to efficiently process and analyze large datasets.
        3. **Architecture Improvements**: The A100 utilizes the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, which offers significant improvements over the previous Volta architecture used in the V100. These improvements include better memory management and higher efficiency, making it feasible to include more memory.
        4. **Market Expectations**: As the industry progresses, there's a continuous push for more powerful computing resources. NVIDIA designed the A100 to meet these growing demands, ensuring it remains competitive by including more memory to handle larger and more complex workloads.
        5. **Use Case Flexibility**: With more memory, the A100 can cater to a wider range of applications, from AI training and inference to high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. This flexibility makes it a more versatile and attractive option for data centers that handle diverse workloads.
        
        The A100 doesn't just have more memory; it also includes several architectural enhancements over the V100 that improve its overall performance and efficiency, further justifying its place as the successor in NVIDIA's GPU lineup.
